When Harriet A. Allen awoke, she wanted to believe that she was ok, that she was in her bed, with her cat next to her, and the dream she’d had was just another in a series of persistent nightmares, and not that she was on the floor of her dream school and favourite museum.

But when her eyes opened, it was to the faces of her PhD cohort surrounding her, and a frantic research assistant forcing them back. 

“Don’t move Harriet, help is on the way! Just stay down there. Someone give me a jacket to put under her head!” The familiar voice yelled out, half at her, half at the crowd of tourists and students around them. “Everything is going to be ok. You’ve had a bit of an accident.”

What no one could have predicted, was Harriet’s reaction when they did eventually make it down to the first floor, to the Spitzer Hall of Humans.
