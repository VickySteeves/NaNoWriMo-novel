## Synopsis: 
A young woman entering her first year as a phD student in New York City's American Museum of Natural History's Richard Gilder Graduate School has a strange encounter while on her first school tour of the Museum. As she passes by the Spitzer Hall of Humans, she remembers...something she was supposed to forget forever. Her journey to bring back her memories leads her down a path she never would have expected.
