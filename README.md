## About
This repository will hold my submissions for [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/about), or NaNoWriMo. From their website:
> On November 1, participants begin working towards the goal of writing a 50,000-word novel by 11:59 PM on November 30.

[This](http://nanowrimo.org/participants/vickysteeves/novels/novel-1106045) is my official novel submission via the NaNoWriMo website.
